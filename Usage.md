##Using the Project

**Step 1:** Install Java 8 (or higher), then download the JAR file from the README. 
**Step 2:** Run the proxy by running command: `java -Xmx256M -jar dragonproxy*.jar` where `256M` indicates memory size.
**Step 3:** Close the server by typing `stop` in the console. 
**Step 4:** Edit `config.yml` and change `remote_ip` and `remote_port` to your Minecraft PC/Mac server, such as `127.0.0.1` and `25565`. 
**Step 5:** Do `Step 2` again, and you should be able to connect to a PC/Mac server through your computer/server from Pocket/Win 10 Edition.
